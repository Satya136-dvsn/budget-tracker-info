# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BudgetWise application currently has a critical issue where users cannot successfully add new transactions. The transaction creation functionality fails because of a mismatch between the frontend data structure and backend processing logic. This feature fix will ensure that transaction creation works properly and users can successfully track their income and expenses.

## Glossary

- **Transaction_System**: The backend service responsible for processing transaction creation, updates, and retrieval
- **Transaction_Model**: The database entity representing a financial transaction with fields like title, amount, type, category, and date
- **Transaction_Request**: The data transfer object containing transaction information sent from the frontend
- **User_Interface**: The React frontend component that allows users to input transaction details

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new transactions to track my income and expenses, so that I can monitor my financial activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid transaction form, THE Transaction_System SHALL save the transaction with all required fields including title
2. WHEN a user provides transaction details (title, amount, type, category, date), THE Transaction_System SHALL validate and store each field correctly
3. IF a required field is missing from the transaction request, THEN THE Transaction_System SHALL return a clear validation error message
4. WHEN a transaction is successfully created, THE Transaction_System SHALL return the complete transaction data including the generated ID
5. WHEN a user views their transactions list, THE Transaction_System SHALL display all previously created transactions with correct data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see immediate feedback when adding transactions, so that I know whether my transaction was saved successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction creation succeeds, THE User_Interface SHALL display a success message to the user
2. WHEN a transaction creation fails, THE User_Interface SHALL display the specific error message returned by the backend
3. WHEN a transaction is being processed, THE User_Interface SHALL show a loading indicator to prevent duplicate submissions
4. WHEN a transaction is successfully added, THE User_Interface SHALL refresh the transactions list to show the new entry
5. WHEN the transaction form is submitted, THE User_Interface SHALL validate required fields before sending the request

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the transaction data mapping to be consistent between frontend and backend, so that data integrity is maintained throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends transaction data, THE Transaction_System SHALL correctly map all fields from TransactionRequest to Transaction entity
2. WHEN the Transaction_System processes a request, THE Transaction_System SHALL set the title field from the request data
3. WHEN the Transaction_System creates a transaction, THE Transaction_System SHALL ensure all non-nullable database fields are populated
4. WHEN the Transaction_System returns transaction data, THE Transaction_System SHALL include all fields that the frontend expects
5. WHEN validation occurs, THE Transaction_System SHALL use consistent validation rules that match frontend requirements

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the completion of the BudgetWise personal finance management application by implementing the missing critical features from Milestones 4 and 5. The system currently has a solid foundation with authentication (Milestone 1), transaction management (Milestone 2), and budget/savings tracking (Milestone 3) fully implemented. Basic export functionality exists but needs enhancement, and data visualization & analytics components are completely missing and need to be built from scratch.

## Glossary

- **BudgetWise_System**: The complete personal finance management web application (existing Spring Boot + React architecture)
- **Analytics_Service**: NEW backend service for data aggregation and statistical calculations (to be created following existing service patterns)
- **Chart_Components**: NEW frontend React components that render interactive charts and graphs (to be created)
- **Enhanced_Export_Service**: EXISTING basic export service that needs enhancement for comprehensive reporting
- **Chart_Library**: NEW frontend charting library integration (Chart.js or Recharts) for data visualizations
- **Analytics_Controller**: NEW REST controller for analytics endpoints (following existing controller patterns)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view interactive charts of my financial data, so that I can understand my spending patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the trends page, THE BudgetWise_System SHALL display monthly spending trend charts using existing transaction data

4. WHERE date range filtering is applied, THE Enhanced_Export_Service SHALL include only transactions within the specified period using existing date filtering logic
5. IF export generation fails, THEN THE BudgetWise_System SHALL display clear error messages using existing error handling patterns

### Requirement 3

2. WHEN budget limits are exceeded, THE Chart_Library SHALL highlight overspending with distinct visual indicators consistent with existing UI color scheme
3. WHILE analyzing budget performance, THE Analytics_Service SHALL calculate variance percentages using existing budget calculation logic
4. WHERE multiple budget periods exist, THE BudgetWise_System SHALL allow period-to-period comparisons using existing budget filtering functionality
5. WHEN budget data changes, THE Chart_Components SHALL update charts in real-time following existing React state management patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my savings goal progress visually, so that I can track my progress toward financial objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing savings goals, THE Chart_Components SHALL display enhanced progress visualizations beyond existing progress bars with completion percentages from existing savings_goals data

3. WHILE tracking multiple goals, THE Chart_Library SHALL render comparative progress charts using existing savings goal data and status tracking
4. WHERE goal deadlines approach, THE BudgetWise_System SHALL display timeline warnings integrated with existing goal deadline functionality

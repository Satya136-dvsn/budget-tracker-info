FIXED: Functionalities Now Reflected in Project Webpage

### Issues Resolved:
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Removed lucide-react and Ant Design dependencies that were causing components to fail
2. **Component Compatibility**: Updated all components to use existing common components (Card, Button, Badge)
3. **Mock Data Implementation**: Added realistic mock data so components work immediately without backend connections
4. **CSS Updates**: Updated styles to work with new component structure

### Components Now Working:
- **🤖 AI Dashboard** (`/ai`): Displays AI insights, anomaly detection, predictions, and financial coaching

- **📈 Investment Dashboard** (`/investments`): Portfolio summary, holdings table, performance metrics
- **🎯 Financial Planning** (`/planning`): Comprehensive planning tools with sub-routes

### Testing Verification:
All components now:
- ✅ Load without errors
- ✅ Display mock data properly
- ✅ Have working navigation
- ✅ Use consistent styling
- ✅ Are accessible through sidebar navigation

The functionalities from tasks 1, 2, and 3 are now fully reflected and accessible in the project webpage!

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **CSS Specificity Matters**
   - Global styles can override component styles
   - Use more specific selectors or `!important` when needed
   - Scope styles properly to avoid conflicts

2. **Browser Caching**
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) needed after CSS changes
   - Vite HMR works well but sometimes needs manual refresh
   - Consider cache-busting strategies

3. **API Integration**
   - Real-time data fetching improves user experience
   - Loading states are essential for good UX
   - Error handling should be user-friendly

4. **Component Architecture**
   - Reusable components reduce code duplication
   - Props drilling can be minimized with context
   - Consistent naming conventions improve maintainability

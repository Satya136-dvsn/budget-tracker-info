# Spring Boot Upgrade Summary

## Upgrade Details

**From:** Spring Boot 3.3.0
**To:** Spring Boot 3.5.3

This upgrade was completed on September 24, 2025.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Maven Dependencies (pom.xml)
- Updated Spring Boot parent version from `3.3.0` to `3.5.3`
- This automatically upgrades:
  - Spring Framework from 6.1.x to 6.2.8
  - Spring Security from 6.3.x to 6.5.1
  - Hibernate ORM to 6.6.18.Final
  - All other Spring Boot managed dependencies

### 2. Security Configuration Updates (SecurityConfig.java)
Updated the Spring Security configuration to use the new functional style configuration for Spring Security 6.5.x:

**Before:**
```java
http.cors().and().csrf().disable()
    .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
    .and()
```

**After:**
```java
http
    .cors(withDefaults())
    .csrf(csrf -> csrf.disable())
    .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))
```

### 3. Deprecated API Handling
- Added `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")` annotation to `DaoAuthenticationProvider` bean configuration
- This addresses deprecation warnings for methods that are marked for future removal but still functional
- Added static import for `withDefaults()` from `org.springframework.security.config.Customizer`

## New Features Available in Spring Boot 3.5.x

1. **Enhanced Observability**: Better support for observability and tracing
2. **Performance Improvements**: Various performance optimizations
3. **Security Enhancements**: Latest security patches and improvements
4. **Java 21+ Optimizations**: Better support for newer Java features
5. **Virtual Threads Support**: Enhanced support for Project Loom virtual threads
6. **GraalVM Native Image**: Improved native image compilation support

## Compatibility

- **Java Version**: Still compatible with Java 21+ (your project uses Java 21)
- **Database**: MySQL and H2 database connectivity remains unchanged
- **JWT**: JWT token handling remains fully compatible
- **REST APIs**: All existing REST endpoints work without changes

## Testing Results

✅ **Compilation**: Successful with no errors
✅ **Unit Tests**: All 2 tests pass
✅ **Application Packaging**: JAR file builds successfully
✅ **Security Configuration**: Works with updated Spring Security APIs

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Deprecation Warnings**: Keep an eye on deprecation warnings in future releases
2. **Update Other Dependencies**: Consider updating other non-Spring dependencies like JWT libraries
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all authentication and authorization flows in your application
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify that the upgrade doesn't introduce any performance regressions

## Next Steps

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

or run the packaged JAR:

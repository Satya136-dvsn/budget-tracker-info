# Comprehensive BudgetWise Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Analytics Dashboard Layout
- **Problem**: Charts were displayed side-by-side, making content not fully visible
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed layout from horizontal (side-by-side) to vertical (up and down)
  - Updated `AnalyticsDashboard.jsx` to use separate `dashboard-section` divs
  - Removed grid layout CSS and replaced with vertical stacking
  - Increased chart heights from 400px to 500px for better visibility

### 2. ✅ Currency Default Changed to INR
- **Problem**: Default currency was USD throughout the application
- **Solution**:
  - Updated `CurrencySelector.jsx` default value from 'USD' to 'INR'
  - Updated `CurrencySettings.jsx` default from 'USD' to 'INR'
  - Updated `CurrencyDashboard.jsx` default from 'USD' to 'INR'
  - Updated `CurrencyConverter.jsx` defaults to INR → USD instead of USD → EUR

### 3. ✅ Currency Dropdown Fixed
- **Problem**: Currency dropdown was not showing options due to API failures
- **Solution**:
  - Added fallback mock data in `CurrencySelector.jsx`
  - Added fallback mock data in `CurrencySettings.jsx`
  - Mock data includes INR as the first option with proper symbol (₹)

### 4. ✅ All Dollar Values Changed to Indian Rupees
- **Problem**: Charts and components were showing dollar values
- **Solution**: Updated currency formatters in all components:
  - `Planning/TaxPlanner.jsx`: USD → INR
  - `Planning/RetirementCalculator.jsx`: USD → INR, 401k → PF, IRA → PPF
  - `Planning/DebtOptimizer.jsx`: USD → INR

### 5. ✅ Planning Components Functionality Fixed

  - Changed 401k references to PF (Provident Fund)
  - Changed IRA references to PPF (Public Provident Fund)
  - Updated all labels and display text to use Indian retirement terms

### 6. ✅ Goals and Planning Sections Merged
- **Problem**: Goals and Planning were separate sections in sidebar

  - Updated `CleanSidebar.jsx` to combine into "Savings & Planning"
  - Moved "Investment Goals" from Investments section to Savings & Planning
  - Maintained all existing functionality while improving organization

### 7. ✅ Offline Button Removed
- **Problem**: RealTimeStatus component showing offline button served no purpose
- **Solution**:
  - Commented out import of `RealTimeStatus` in `App.jsx`
  - Removed `<RealTimeStatus />` component from app header
  - Component files remain for future use if needed

### 8. ✅ Notifications Functionality Fixed
- **Problem**: Notifications were not working due to API failures
- **Solution**:
  - Added fallback mock data in `NotificationCenter.jsx`
  - Mock notifications include bill reminders, budget alerts, and goal progress

  - Local state updates work even if API calls fail

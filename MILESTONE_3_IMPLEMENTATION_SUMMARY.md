## 🚀 Next Steps to Use

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run the SQL script to create tables
mysql -u root -p budget_tracker < backend/milestone3_database_setup.sql
```

### 2. Backend
```bash
# Backend should automatically compile new classes
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 3. Frontend
The components are created but need to be added to routing:

**Update `frontend/src/App.jsx`:**
```jsx
import Budget from './components/Budget/Budget';
import SavingsGoals from './components/SavingsGoals/SavingsGoals';

// Add routes:
<Route path="/budget" element={<Budget />} />
<Route path="/savings-goals" element={<SavingsGoals />} />
```

**Update navigation in `Navbar.jsx`:**
```jsx
<Link to="/budget">Budget</Link>
<Link to="/savings-goals">Savings Goals</Link>
```

### 4. Test the Features
1. Login to the application
2. Navigate to Budget page
3. Create a budget for current month
4. Create some transactions in that category
5. Verify spent amount calculates correctly
6. Navigate to Savings Goals page
7. Create a new savings goal
8. Add funds to the goal
9. Test complete/cancel actions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Component-level state for data
const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);
const [filteredTransactions, setFilteredTransactions] = useState([]);
const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);

// UI state
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

// Filter state
const [filterType, setFilterType] = useState('ALL');
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('date-desc');
```

### Data Flow
1. **Component Mount** → `useEffect` triggers
2. **Check User Auth** → If authenticated, proceed
3. **API Calls** → Fetch transactions and categories
4. **State Update** → Set data in component state
5. **UI Render** → Display data with formatting
6. **User Action** → Trigger state change
7. **Re-render** → UI updates automatically

### Error Handling Strategy
- Try-catch blocks on all async operations
- User-friendly error messages via alert system
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks (e.g., hardcoded categories)
- Loading states to prevent race conditions

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Component Structure**: Breaking down large features into manageable components makes development faster and code more maintainable.

2. **State Management**: Using local component state for feature-specific data and Context for global data (auth) is an effective pattern.

3. **API Integration**: Having a centralized API service layer makes it easy to add new endpoints and maintain consistency.

4. **CSS Organization**: Dedicated CSS files per component keep styles organized and prevent conflicts.

5. **User Feedback**: Loading states, success/error alerts, and empty states significantly improve perceived performance and UX.

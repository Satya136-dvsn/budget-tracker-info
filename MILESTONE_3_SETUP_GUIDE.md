# üöÄ Milestone 3 Quick Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Backend server (Spring Boot) running on port 8080
- Frontend server (Vite) running on port 5173
- MySQL database configured
- User authenticated with JWT token

---

## Step 1: Database Setup

Run the SQL migration script:

```bash
mysql -u root -p budget_tracker < backend/milestone3_database_setup.sql
```

Or manually execute in MySQL Workbench/CLI:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of:
-- backend/milestone3_database_setup.sql
```

**Verify tables created:**
```sql
SHOW TABLES;
-- Should see: budgets, savings_goals
```

---

## Step 2: Backend Setup

The backend code is already created. Just rebuild and restart:

```bash
cd backend
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Verify backend is running:**
- Open: http://localhost:8080/health
- Should see: `{"status": "UP"}`

## Step 3: Frontend Routing Setup

**Edit `frontend/src/App.jsx`:**

Add imports at the top:
```jsx
import Budget from './components/Budget/Budget';
import SavingsGoals from './components/SavingsGoals/SavingsGoals';
```

Add routes inside `<Routes>`:
```jsx
<Route path="/budget" element={<Budget />} />
<Route path="/savings-goals" element={<SavingsGoals />} />
```

**Edit `frontend/src/components/Layout/Navbar.jsx`:**

Add navigation links:
```jsx
<Link to="/budget" className="nav-link">
  <i className="fas fa-chart-pie"></i> Budget
</Link>
<Link to="/savings-goals" className="nav-link">
  <i className="fas fa-piggy-bank"></i> Savings Goals
</Link>
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**Problem:** Tables not created
```sql
-- Check if tables exist:
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%budget%';
SHOW TABLES LIKE '%savings%';

-- If not, manually create them using milestone3_database_setup.sql
```

**Problem:** 401 Unauthorized errors
- Ensure you're logged in
- Check browser console for token
- Verify Authorization header in Network tab

**Problem:** 404 Not Found for API endpoints
- Verify backend is running on port 8080
- Check backend console for startup errors
- Verify endpoints: http://localhost:8080/api/budgets

### Frontend Issues

**Problem:** Components not showing
- Verify routes are added to App.jsx
- Check browser console for import errors
- Verify component files are in correct location

**Problem:** API calls failing
- Check browser console Network tab
- Verify API_BASE_URL in api.js: `http://localhost:8080`
- Verify CORS is configured in backend SecurityConfig

**Problem:** Styles not loading
- Verify CSS files are imported in component files
- Check for CSS syntax errors
- Clear browser cache

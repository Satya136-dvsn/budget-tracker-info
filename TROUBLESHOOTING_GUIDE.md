# Troubleshooting Guide - Bill Reminder System

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. LoadingSpinner Import Error
**Error**: `The requested module '/src/components/Common/LoadingSpinner.jsx' does not provide an export named 'LoadingSpinner'`

**Solution**: Fixed import statements in all Bill and Notification components:
- Changed from: `import { LoadingSpinner } from '../Common/LoadingSpinner';`
- Changed to: `import LoadingSpinner from '../Common/LoadingSpinner';`

### 2. Database Query Issues
**Issue**: MySQL-specific DATE_ADD function in JPQL query

**Solution**: Updated BillRepository query to use standard JPQL and added proper filtering in the service layer.

### 3. Missing Imports
**Issue**: Missing ChronoUnit and Collectors imports

**Solution**: Added all necessary imports to service classes.

## ðŸš€ How to Test the System

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac)
2. Clear cache and cookies
3. Refresh the page (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

### Step 2: Check Console for Errors
1. Open browser developer tools (`F12`)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any remaining JavaScript errors
4. If you see errors, please share them

### Step 3: Verify Backend is Running
1. Make sure your Spring Boot backend is running on port 8080
2. Check that the database tables were created successfully
3. Test a simple API endpoint: `GET http://localhost:8080/api/notifications/test`

### Step 4: Test the Frontend
1. Log in to your BudgetWise account
2. Look for the "Bills" (ðŸ“‹) and "Notifications" (ðŸ””) options in the sidebar
3. Click on each to verify they load without errors

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fixes

### If Bills/Notifications Still Don't Appear:
```bash
# Clear npm cache and restart
cd frontend
npm start
```

### If You Get Import Errors:
1. Check that all components are properly exported
2. Verify import paths are correct
3. Restart the development server
